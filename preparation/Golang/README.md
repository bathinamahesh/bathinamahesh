## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Core Concepts to Master

- 🌀 **Goroutines** — lightweight concurrency primitives managed by the Go runtime  
- 🔄 **Channels** — typed conduits for goroutine communication & synchronization  
- 🧭 **Context** — request-scoped cancellation, deadlines, and values  
- 🧮 **Coordination primitives** — `sync.WaitGroup`, `sync.Mutex`, `select`, timers  
- 🧠 **Patterns** — fan-out/fan-in, worker pools, pipelines, timeout/cancellation handling

## 📘 3️⃣ Next / Advanced Topics (planned)

- Go scheduler internals (G-P-M model) & runtime behavior  
- Garbage collector & memory model  
- Profiling and debugging (pprof, trace, race detector)  
- Structured concurrency & graceful shutdown patterns  
- Testing concurrent code and benchmarking

💬 **Recommended flow:**  
1. Start with *Mario Carrion* concurrency playlist to get comfortable with goroutines & channels.  
2. Learn Go design patterns from *We Build Developers* for idiomatic structuring.  
3. Use Mario Carrion’s architecture demos to apply patterns in real systems and learn system design with Go.
